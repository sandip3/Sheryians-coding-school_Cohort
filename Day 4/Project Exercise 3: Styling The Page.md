SHERYIANS CODING SCHOOL

- What TO DoL
  - HTML First, Simple Structure: Create basic HTML with divs (header, nav,sidebar, main, footer) and placeholder text.
  - Link CSS: Connect styles.css to your HTML in <head>.
  - display Exploration: Try display: block, inline, inline-block, none, flex, grid on elements. See the changes.
  - Flexbox for 2 Columns: Use display: flex on body. Experiment with flex-direction, justify-content, align-items. flex-grow: 1 for main content.
  - Use Inspect Element: Crucial! Use browser tools to see CSS and experiment live.
  - One Property at a Time: Change one CSS rule, then check the browser.
  - Read Solution Comments: Understand why the solution code works.

- Ask Questions: Get help when stuck!

- What NOT to DoL
    - Don't Start Complex: Focus on layout basics first, styling later.
    - Don't Overwhelm Yourself: Focus on display, Flexbox, positioning, overflow for now.
    - Don't Skip Inspect Element: It's essential for learning.
    - Don't Fear Experimenting: Breaking things is part of learning.
    - Don't Just Copy Solution: Try yourself first, then understand the solution.
