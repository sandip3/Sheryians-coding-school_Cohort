                <p>Hey there! I’m <b>Sandip</b>, and welcome to <b>My Simple Blog!</b></p>

                <p>I started this blog to share my journey of learning, discovering, and growing in the world of coding,
                    web
                    development,
                    and all things tech. But that’s not all – I also love diving into the amazing worlds of Manga,
                    Manhwa,
                    and
                    Manhua, which
                    fuel my imagination and creativity.</p>

                <p>This blog is my space to share helpful tips on coding, my experiences as a beginner, and a bit of fun
                    with
                    the stories I
                    love. Whether you’re here to learn coding, explore exciting new comics, or just have a good laugh,
                    I’m
                    thrilled to have
                    you here!</p>
