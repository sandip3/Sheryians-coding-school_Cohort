        <p>Hey there! I’m <b>Sandip</b>, and welcome to <b>My Simple Blog!</b></p>

        <p>I started this blog to share my journey of learning, discovering, and growing in the world of coding, web
            development,
            and all things tech. But that’s not all – I also love diving into the amazing worlds of Manga, Manhwa, and
            Manhua, which
            fuel my imagination and creativity.</p>

        <p>This blog is my space to share helpful tips on coding, my experiences as a beginner, and a bit of fun with
            the stories I
            love. Whether you’re here to learn coding, explore exciting new comics, or just have a good laugh, I’m
            thrilled to have
            you here!</p>

        <p>Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy reading my posts as much as I enjoy writing them!</p>

        <p><b>P.S.</b> This blog is part of my <b>HTML class assignment</b>! 📝 So, all the cool stuff you see here is
            made
            using <b>HTML</b>
            only for
            my assignment. 😎</p>
